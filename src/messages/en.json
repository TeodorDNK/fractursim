        "longDescription": "In 'The Eternal in Error,' the canonical form of classical beauty is subjected to controlled disassembly. The sculpture, once a symbol of order, reason, and harmony, is traversed by flows of visual rupture, chromatic errors, and digital interference. Thus, the image becomes a field of tension between two worlds: one of mythical stability and another of contemporary instability.\n\nFragmentation does not destroy, it reveals. Error is not just a technical flaw, but an existential principle. The face does not disintegrate gratuitously, but is 'rewritten' by the chaos of the present time. In this fissure between what was considered eternal and what is inevitably unstable, the fracturist meaning of the work is born.\n\nColor — between cold turquoise, electric pink, and mineral grey — functions as a pulsation between life, memory, and the artificial. The natural and architectural background evokes a world still recognizable, but already contaminated by distortion, suggesting that no space remains intact in the face of error.\n\n'The Eternal in Error' is not a mere representation of degradation, but a meditation on identity in the age of fragmentation. It is the portrait of a humanity that, while leaning on the forms of the past, is condemned to continually reconfigure itself through fissure, through defect, through instability.",

        "title": "Reality is mediated, filtered, fragmented",
        "caption": "An immobilized body in a clinical space gazes, through technological artifice, towards a world that no longer belongs to it. Reality is mediated, filtered, fragmented. Freedom exists only as simulation. Consciousness remains captive between cold walls and digital promises.",
        "longDescription": "The work represents a state of suspension between life and projection, between body and escape, between harsh present and comforting illusion. The character, immobilized in a hospital bed, is connected not to reality, but to an idealized reconstruction of it: an island, a calm sea, a sky without illness. But this freedom is merely an interface.\n\nVR goggles become the fracturist symbol of artificial escape — a rupture between what is lived and what is allowed to be imagined. The cold, medical room is possessed by an almost uniform blue, a sign of stagnation, of time that no longer flows naturally, but is measured by machines. The clock in the background no longer indicates life, but its monitoring.\n\nHappiness is projected onto the wall as a landscape without a body, without pain, without weight. The palm tree and the sea are not real — they are merely codifications of the human desire to escape suffering. Thus, the work does not speak of hope, but of dependence on simulacrum.\n\nThe fracture is not visually violent, but silent: between the vulnerable body and the perfect universe, between biological limits and the promise of the digital infinite. Man no longer dreams — he is connected to his own illusion.\n\nThis is a meditation on a future where suffering is not healed, but blurred by image. A world where pain no longer disappears, but is merely covered with artificial light.",

        "longDescription": "„Fractured Genesis” is a painterly work realized in the spirit of Fracturism, in which classical forms merge with deliberate ruptures, chromatic distortions, and visual fragments inspired by digital aesthetics. In the center of the composition, the human figure becomes a symbol of split identity, caught in a continuous process of disintegration and reconstruction.\nThe warm, earthy tones are pierced by neon accents, created to amplify the tension between the organic and the artificial, between the pictorial past and the technological present. Painted surfaces alternate between near-Renaissance details and 'fractured' areas: pictorial glitches, fragmented lines, superimposed layers, and broken geometries that reveal the fragility of contemporary perception.\nSubtle elements – broken mirrors, shadows of memory, traces of code, and faded symbols – function as reference points for the central themes of Fracturism: the erosion of identity, the overwriting of reality, and the aesthetics of imperfection.\nThe work does not seek to heal the rupture, but to make it visible. 'Fractured Genesis' is a visual testimony to the modern individual: broken, oversaturated, yet profoundly authentic in their own disorder.",

The image starts from a realistic portrait over which fragmented layers, deliberate glitches, and chromatic distortions are superimposed.",
        "longDescription": "„Echoes of Scattered Identity” is a work where the woman's face disintegrates like a dream reflected in a cracked mirror. Her fragments float between two worlds: one warm and earthy, like a memory, and another cold, electric, like a signal lost in the vastness of the digital.\n\nShades of sienna and ochre try to preserve the familiar contour, while magenta and cyan pulsate like an intrusion, a warning, a truth impossible to ignore.\n\nThe portrait breathes in a broken rhythm. One part remains human and tender, the other breaks, pixelates, and evaporates into glitch — exactly where identity becomes an echo, and the echo remains the only proof of a long-lost wholeness.",

The work is composed of four distinct vertical segments, each realized in a different stylistic register: classical realism, digital glitch, geometric abstraction, and expressionistic distortion.",
        "longDescription": "„The Anatomy of a New Identity” explores how contemporary identity forms, breaks, and reassembles at the border between the past and the digital age. The portrait is divided into four vertical sections, each painted in an autonomous style — classical realism, digital glitch, geometric abstraction, and expressionistic distortion.\n\nEach fragment seems detached from a different visual world, yet together they reconstruct a coherent figure, caught in a continuous transition. Chromatic interferences — from warm, natural tones in the realistic area to electric cyan, saturated magenta, and neon yellow in the digital segments — highlight the tension between the original and the reconfigured identity.\n\nTraditional pictorial textures, juxtaposed with digital errors, fractured pixels, and broken geometries, create an unstable harmony that suggests the fragility of the self in the era of informational oversaturation. The work functions as a 'digital X-ray of the self,' a visual dissection of the process by which we become multiple identities superimposed between reality, technology, and memory.",

        "caption": "„The Digit That Dreams of Being Human” presents a digitized humanoid figure on the border between artificial and human, trying to overcome its algorithmic nature. Glitched forms and code fragments intertwine with attempts at organicity, and the cold color scheme, traversed by neon accents, emphasizes this transformation. The meditative gaze suggests the desire for identity, turning the work into a metaphor for the age where even humans are continuously reconstructed from fragmented data, images, and memory.",
        "longDescription": "„The Digit That Dreams of Being Human” explores the fundamental tension between artificial and human, between code and consciousness. The humanoid figure, composed of digital fragments, dispersed pixels, random patterns, and binary code lines, seems to gradually detach from its own mathematical nature to seek a beginning of organic identity.\n\nThe composition uses a palette dominated by deep blue, muted gold, and neon accents, suggesting the transfer between two worlds. The upper part of the portrait, unstable and fragmented by glitches, appears to be in the midst of a rewriting process; the lower part tries to gain volume, texture, a simulated 'flesh.' This visual duality reveals the effort of a digital construct to become something more than looping algorithms.\n\nThe calm, meditative side-gaze conveys a desire for self-transcendence: a digit that aspires to be human. Every pictorial, digital, and fractured layer represents a stage in the search for synchronization between the mechanical and the organic, the virtual and the real, identity and projection.\n\nThe work becomes a metaphor for the contemporary world — a time when we, too, are constantly reconstructed from information, data, images, and fragments of our own memory.",
